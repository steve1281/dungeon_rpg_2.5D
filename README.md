Godot 4 C# Action Adventure: Build your own 2.5D RPG 

A GameDev.tv course, instructor is Luis Ramirez

I developed in : 4.5.dev2.mono

Key points (for me):
- Using C# in GODOT, with some C# ideas (lambda, inheritance, etc) covered
- GPU Particles
- Shaders
- StateMachine logic
- Using glft/glb models
  
Presented with challenges, explanations, etc.  

The best example of this type of course I have seen so far.
